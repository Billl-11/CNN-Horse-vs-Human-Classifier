## Introduction

The objective of this project is to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying images of horses and humans. CNNs are a popular deep learning architecture for image classification tasks as they can effectively capture spatial hierarchies and patterns in images.

## CNN Model Architecture

The CNN model in this repository is implemented using Python and the TensorFlow library. The architecture consists of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification.

The CNN model architecture is as follows:

Convolutional Layers: Convolutional layers apply filters to input images, extracting relevant features through convolutions. The filters learn various patterns and spatial representations.

Pooling Layers: Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the convolved features while retaining important information. Max pooling is typically used to downsample the features.

Fully Connected Layers: Fully connected layers take the flattened output from the convolutional and pooling layers and perform classification based on learned features. These layers combine the extracted features to make predictions.
